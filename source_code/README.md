# Guide: How to use?

## If you are using an IDE (PyCharm, Visual studio, etc):
1. Download all the files in this folder
2. Make sure they are in the same local directory
3. Open the file main.py
4. Run the file using a local IDE
5. Follow the instructions in the console
6. Congrats, you have a powerful working program in your hands.

**NB.** Perhaps, the easiest way is to use file input. Just change the content of the test.txt file and use it for your experiments.

## If you are compiling the code online:
1. Copy all the file content in the virtual IDE
2. Make sure you use the following order: input_methods -> fdtc_fractions -> main
3. Remove all the rows that include the words above (from input_methods import \*, from fdtc_fractions import \*)
4. Run your program and follow the instructions

**NB.** In this case, the file method is unavailable.
