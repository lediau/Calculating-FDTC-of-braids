# Guide: How to use?

First, note that the ```experiment.py``` file can only be changed manually. In other words, one has to change some rows in the source code, in order to be able to run experiments on one's own. Nevertheless, everyone can easily calculate the FDTC of braids automatically. Here is how:

## If you are using an IDE (PyCharm, Visual studio, etc):
1. Download all the files in this folder
2. Make sure they are in the same local directory
3. Open the file ```main.py```
4. Run the file using a local IDE
5. Follow the instructions in the console
6. Congrats, you have a powerful working program in your hands.

**NB.** Perhaps, the easiest way is to use file input. Just change the content of the ```test.txt``` file and use it for your experiments.

## If you are compiling the code online:
1. Copy all the file content in the virtual IDE
2. Make sure you use the following order: ```input_methods``` -> ```fdtc_fractions``` -> ```main```
3. Remove the following two rows (```from input_methods import *```, ```from fdtc_fractions import *```)
4. Run your program and follow the instructions

**NB.** In this case, the file method is unavailable.
